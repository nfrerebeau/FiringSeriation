  abstract = {Mineralogical, textural and chemical analyses of clay-rich materials following firing, evidence that initial mineralogical differences between two raw materials (one with carbonates and the other without) influence the textural and mineralogical evolution of the ceramics as T increases from 700 to 1100°C. Mineralogical and textural changes are interpreted considering local marked disequilibria in a system that resembles a small-scale high-T metamorphic process (e.g., contact aureoles in pyrometamorphism). In such conditions, rapid heating induces significant overstepping in mineral reaction, preventing stable phase formation and favoring metastable ones. High-T transformations in non-carbonate materials include microcline structure collapse and/or partial transformation into sanidine; and mullite plus sanidine formation at the expenses of muscovite and/or illite at T 800°C. Mullite forms by muscovite-out topotactic replacement, following the orientation of mica crystals: i.e., former (001)muscovite are ┴ to (001)mullite. This reaction is favored by minimization of free energy during phase transition. Partial melting followed by fingered structure development at the carbonate-silicate reaction interface enhanced high-T Ca (and Mg) silicates formation in carbonate-rich materials. Gehlenite, wollastonite, diopside, and anorthite form at carbonate-silicate interfaces by combined mass transport (viscous flow) and reaction-diffusion processes. These results may add to a better understanding of the complex high-T transformations of silicate phases in both natural (e.g., pyrometamorphism) and artificial (e.g., ceramic processing) systems. This information is important to elucidate technological achievements and raw material sources of ancient civilizations and, it can also be used to select appropriate clay composition and firing temperatures for new bricks used in cultural heritage conservation interventions.},

  abstract = {Ceramic fragments from the archaeological excavation of the Iberian–Roman city of Basti (Spain) were studied from a geochemical point of view and by applying a statistical tool to X-ray fluorescence data to discover similarities between ceramic materials. The analysis of these samples was completed by performing a mineralogical analysis, textural observation, and by characterizing the porous system and the colour of the pieces. Our results enabled us to identify the source area of the clayey raw material in the surroundings of Basti and to estimate the firing temperature of the ceramics. Differences in the chemistry were confirmed by characteristics of the pastes and the mineralogical composition of the pieces. Some samples show black cores, which would suggest the presence of organic matter in the raw material and fast firing of the ceramics. The main types of temper were quartz grains and gneiss fragments, although carbonate grains were also identified. Our evidence suggests that most of the samples were well fired. New silicate phases were found to be present in several samples. The mercury intrusion porosimetry verified and confirmed the firing temperature of non-carbonated samples. Colorimetry showed that the colour of the ceramics varied according to the amount of CaO that they contained.},

  abstract = {Thirty-two ceramic fragments dating from the Early Iberian Age were collected in Canto Tortoso, an archaeological site located about 100 km from the city of Granada (Spain). The site is on a hill bordered by two rivers, the Fardes and the Guadiana Menor. The ceramics are divided equally into amphorae and vessels and half of them have black cores. The samples are rich in SiO2 and Al2O3, with varying amounts of CaO, Fe2O3, MgO and K2O. The most common mineral is quartz and almost all the samples have muscovite-type phyllosilicates. Calcite appears as small grains dispersed in the matrix and sometimes also of secondary origin covering the surface of samples or filling the pores. One ceramic was richer in calcite grains than quartz. An incipient decomposition of this carbonate is detected even at low firing temperatures. Samples fired at high temperatures are characterised by the presence of mullite or gehlenite and/or diopside phases. These silicates are also accompanied by a vitreous phase that increases the interlocking between the particles and changes the morphology of the pores from angular to round. The precipitation of phases of secondary origin on the surface of the ceramics may have minimised the chromatic differences between Ca-rich and Ca-poor samples. The combined use of chemical, petrographic and physical techniques allowed us to estimate the firing temperature of the ceramic samples (most samples were well-fired) and to discover the provenance of the raw material (a clayey material found near a kiln located just 3 km away from the settlement has a mineralogical composition compatible with that of the ceramics).},

Most of these amphorae were found in underwater environments on both coasts of the Straits of Gibraltar: Ceuta and Cadiz (Spain). A multivariate statistical study of the obtained data for 99 samples and 21 variables (Si, Al, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Mn, Ti, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, calcite, quartz, dolomite, orthoclase, plagioclase, phyllosilicates and gypsum) was performed. Relations among amphorae that shared a similar composition were established by factor analysis. As a result, amphorae coming from Cadiz showed a different composition than those coming from Ceuta. This is demonstrated by the increase in concentration of certain chemical elements, such as Cu, Cr and Ca. This fact supports the archaeological hypothesis that some amphorae of South-Hispanic typology found in Ceuta were produced locally, although there is no proof of the existence of kilns in this area. On the other hand, neither the different typologies nor the food stored or transported in these amphorae seem to affect the mineralogical and chemical composition of the ceramic pastes. However, their porosity contributes to the enrichment in trace elements and salt contents in those samples that had been in marine underwater contexts for a large period of time.},

  abstract = {X-ray diffraction scans consist of series of counts; these numbers obey Poisson distributions with varying expected values. These scans are often smoothed and the Kα2 component is removed. This article proposes a framework in which both issues are treated. Penalized likelihood estimation is used to smooth the data. The penalty combines the Poisson log-likelihood and a measure for roughness based on ideas from generalized linear models. To remove the Kα doublet the model is extended using the composite link model. As a result the data are decomposed into two smooth components: a Kα1 and a Kα2 part. For both smoothing and Kα2 removal, the weight of the applied penalty is optimized automatically. The proposed methods are applied to experimental data and compared with the Savitzky–Golay algorithm for smoothing and the Rachinger method for Kα2 stripping. The new method shows better results with less local distortion. Freely available software in MATLAB and R has been developed.}

During the firing of these bodies, clinopyroxene is usually formed in very small crystals, 1-5 gm in diameter or less. In the literature this phase is generally referred to as diopside, but no quantitative data are available. In order to chemically characterize these 'ceramic' pyroxenes, nine industrial products were analysed by XRF and XRD (bulk sample) and SEM-EDS (fracture surface). Quantitative ZAF analyses of pyroxene crystals showed a certain chemical variability: SiO2 35-50\%, A1203 9-20\%, Fe203 1-15\%, MgO 3-14\%, and CaO 16-25\%. Sodium, K and Ti are always {$<$}1\%, while ferrous iron is always {$<$}0.2\% in the bulk sample. Overall, 'ceramic' clinopyroxenes present wide chemical analogies with 'fassaite', e.g. the abundance of aluminium and ferric iron, and the excess ofwollastonite molecules with respect to the diopside-hedenbergite series.},

Such microtextures, formed by sub-solidus reactions, occur in limited domains of the system, testify for a short-range diffusion of chemical components during the firing process, even if 1050°C were reached in the kiln. Relationships among phases formed during the firing process indicate that their composition is independent of kiln temperatures and is related to the composition of precursor phases on which they grow. The use of data obtained by X-ray diffraction techniques on bulk samples, when used to define firing temperatures of historical artifacts, could be considered.

Making ceramics by firing of clay is essentially a reversal of the natural weathering process of rocks. Millennia ago, potters invented simple pyrotechnologies to recombine the chemical compounds once separated by weathering in order to obtain what is more or less a rock-like product shaped and decorated according to need and preference. Whereas Nature reconsolidates clays by long-term diagenetic or metamorphic transformation processes, potters exploit a ‘short-cut’ of these processes that affects the state of equilibrium of the system being transformed thermally. This ‘short-cut’ is thought to be akin to the development of mineral-reaction textures resulting from disequilibria established during rapidly heated pyrometamorphic events (Grapes, 2006) involving contact aureoles or reactions with xenoliths. In contrast to most naturally consolidated clays, the solidified rock-like ceramic material inherits non-equilibrium and statistical states best described as ‘frozen-in’. The more or less high temperatures applied to clays during ceramic firing result in a distinct state of sintering that is dependent on the firing temperature, the duration of firing, the firing atmosphere, and the composition and grain-size distribution of the clay. Hence, the salient properties of the ceramics have to be assessed in a temperature-time-composition space. Owing to the variability of clay composition, the mineralogical processes during thermal transformation of clay minerals can be very complex, not least because most reactions occur far removed from thermodynamic equilibrium and hence are kinetically controlled; that is, they are time- and temperature-dependent. Indeed, kinetics imposes constraints on thermodynamics by retarding reaction rates because of low temperatures, large temperature gradients present in primitive pottery kilns, short reaction times, inhomogeneously distributed reaction partners, and varying redox conditions triggered, for example, by ingress of air during reducing firing cycles. In the context of ceramic technological development over time, the role and development of pottery technology within complex societies is discussed. The close relationship between pottery development and changes in life/societal organization appears to be a major driver in this endeavour.             In this chapter, the phase evolution of some typical ancient and historical ceramics will be traced using ceramic phase diagrams, i.e. chemographical expressions of Goldschmidt’s mineralogical phase rule. In particular, the systems CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 (in which most ancient low- to medium-fired ceramics can be accommodated), K2O–Al2O3–SiO2 (applicable to high-fired Chinese stoneware and European hard-paste porcelain) and Na2O–CaO–(Al2O3)–SiO2 (typical of some ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian alkaline glazes and French soft-paste porcelain) are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The Reference Intensity Ratio (RIR) is a general, instrument-independent constant for use in quantitative phase analysis by the X-ray powder diffraction internal standard method. When the reference standard is corundum, RIR is known as I/I               c               ; These constants are collected in the Powder Diffraction File (1987), can be calculated, and can be measured. Recommended methods for accurate measurement of RIR constants are presented, and methods of using these constants for quantitative analysis are discussed. The numerous, complex constants in Copeland and Bragg's method introduced to account for superimposed lines can be simply expressed in terms of RIR constants and relative intensities. This formalism also permits introduction of constraints and supplemental equations based on elemental analysis.},

  abstract = {The honour to be the first who published the seriation of archaeological finds by formal methods is attributed by David Kendall (1964) to Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie (1899). According to Harold Driver (1965), an American anthropologist, the earliest numerical seriation studies are those of Kidder (1915), Kroeber (1916), and Spier (1917). It seems, however, that a general acceptance of formal seriation methods did not begin until the pioneering publications of Ford and Willey (1949) and G. W. Brainerd (1951) and W. S. Robinson (1951). Hole and Shaw published an algorithm for permutation search (1967), Elisséeff's (1965) and Goldmann's (1968) methods leading finally to correspondence analysis.},

My main purpose is to assess the actual relationships between the firing procedures (structure, fuel, schedule and scale) and some of the firing conditions (time and temperature). Indeed, if different firing procedures result in different firing conditions, the fired pots might display distinct physical characteristics. I will first characterize the various procedures in terms that are both meaningful for anthropologists and likely to influence the thermal profile of a firing. I will then examine the characteristics of the various firing processes in terms of duration, maximum temperature, heating rate and soaking time.},

Breakdown of chlorite forms an amorphous phase, which continues to retain iron in a (distorted) paramagnetic octahedral site, until carbonates start to decompose and react at 750 °C, forming Ca-silicates. Only at this temperature can hematite nucleate and grow in specific micro-domains located in former chlorite flakes. At 950 °C, decomposition of illite in the presence of an amorphous phase and CaO produces a melt in which nano-sized hematite may nucleate, although its growth is inhibited due to low diffusion with respect to soaking time.},

In this article, we outline a bootstrapped approach to correspondence analysis-based seriation designed to help assess and improve the stability of relative orderings produced through such analyses. This procedure systematically identifies and removes small samples and sites with unusual samples, such as those with multiple components, which are not handled well by seriation and require secondary interpretation. Our approach combines data from multiple projects in the Zuni region of the American Southwest in order to gauge the effects of intraregional variation in ceramic distributions and reexamine prior interpretations of demographic change based on individual projects. This analysis highlights two previously unknown regional trends, including variation in the distribution of multicomponent sites and potential short-term depopulation of a significant part of the region. Based on this example, we further suggest that our method may be particularly useful in situations where little prior chronological information is available.},

Three representative raw materials of these local sediments were chosen for experimental work aiming to evaluate their firing behaviour in a propane-fired kiln, with a different atmosphere and temperature. The determination of mineralogy and microstructure was carried out by XRD and SEM-EDS analysis. For ceramics fired at 850 and 950 °C, no significant mineralogical and microstructural differences were observed between the oxidising and reducing atmosphere. The main pyrometamorphic phases are fassaite, gehlenite, anorthite and wollastonite. On the contrary, at 1050 °C in reducing atmosphere, gehlenite and wollastonite are diminished whereas the content of anorthite, fassaite and amorphous phase is higher. The higher vitrification is attributed to Fe2+ that participates either in the formation of eutectic phases or in low melting crystalline phases.},

During firing, the reaction behaviour of temper grains and clay matrix is dominated by disequilibrium conditions and characterised by the presence of different reacting sub-systems. Each one of them is compositionally well established and corresponds to different mineral phases in mutual contact. Reactions occur following the two main mechanisms: (i) reactions leading to nucleation and growth of new mineral phases (modal reactions) and (ii) reactions producing only compositional variations of phases (cryptic reactions). Modal reactions are given by new phases rimming the temper grains, whereas the cryptic reactions may develop during the partial transformation of a single phase, producing compositional zonings. Kinetic aspects are also considered in order to asses the role exerted by temperature, by bulk and mineral compositions and by fluid phase on the attainment of modal or cryptic reactions during firing.},

The aim of the present paper is to provide a summary and critical assessment of the particular contribution of the physical sciences to the reconstruction and interpretation of this life cycle, in large part through the presentation of selected case studies. The topics covered include the reconstruction of the technology used in pottery production, through a combination of microscopy, radiography, and chemical analysis; the investigation of the extent of craft specialization and the organization of pottery production; the reconstruction of pottery distribution from its production center, using thin-section petrography and chemical analysis, and the interpretation of these data in terms of exchange and trade; the reconstruction of the consumption stage or uses to which pottery was put, from the study of surface wear, organic residues, and performance characteristics; and a discussion of the reasons for the introduction of pottery and for the different technological choices made in pottery production. Throughout, the importance of considering the overall environmental, technological, economic, sociopolitical, cultural-ideological and historical context in which the pottery was produced, distributed, and consumed is emphasized. The paper is concerned, almost-exclusively, with unglazed earthenware spanning prehistory through to circa 1500 AD.},

  abstract = {Clay products can be reinforced by using clay and calcite mixes, even if sintering is at low temperature (1100 °C). The formation of a micro-composite microstructure favours a significant strength increase as fired materials contain anorthite grains embedded in a silico-aluminate matrix. The clay used, rich in kaolinite mineral, is originated from Burkina-Faso. It is contaminated by a moderate iron level, substituted to Al in octahedral sites of kaolinite, influencing the thermal comportment. An alternative approach was also used when substituting the common clay by an almost pure kaolinite mineral, to understand the iron role. In general, during thermal transformations, the reaction sequence of recrystallisation is metakaolinite—gehlenite—anorthite, but mullite was never detected. The interpretations of DTA spectrums indicate increasing activation energy for gehlenite and then anorthite formations. For mullite, although the corresponding activation energy is the lowest, it is not present. This energetically interpretation differs from the analysis of the SiO2-Al2O3-CaO ternary diagram, where transformation paths are not so clear. It is then proposed that the reaction sequence is favoured by the existence of structural similarities between metakaolinite, gehlenite and anorthite, which are pseudo-layered structures. For mullite, the 3D structure is very different, which explains its absence in the material.},
